This is a Web app presentation of the puzzle game Minesweeper. You can generate a Gameboard, and play it by yourself or reveal the mines.
The 8x8 board generates randomly and contains 10 mines. 
If you click all safe tiles (left click) and flag all mines (right click) you win!
Should you left click on a mine you loose!

To start the web app you have to:
- start the MinesweeperApllication Java class (backend)
- install the npm packages with "npm install"
- navigate to the frontend directory and start with "ng serve"

Now everything should be running. You can acces the game now under your localhost with port 4200 ==> http://localhost:4200
